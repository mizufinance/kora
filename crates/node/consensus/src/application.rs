//! Consensus application trait for block proposal and verification.

use alloy_primitives::B256;

/// Application interface for consensus integration.
///
/// This trait defines the hooks that a consensus engine calls during
/// the block lifecycle. Implementations handle block proposal during
/// leadership and block verification for blocks from other validators.
///
/// # Block Lifecycle
///
/// 1. **Proposal**: When this validator is elected leader, [`propose`](Self::propose)
///    is called to build a new block from pending transactions.
///
/// 2. **Verification**: When receiving a block from another validator,
///    [`verify`](Self::verify) re-executes the block to validate the state root.
///
/// 3. **Finalization**: When consensus finalizes a block, [`finalize`](Self::finalize)
///    persists the state changes and prunes the mempool.
///
/// 4. **Seed Updates**: The [`on_seed`](Self::on_seed) callback delivers threshold
///    VRF outputs for use in subsequent block prevrandao fields.
pub trait ConsensusApplication: Clone + Send + Sync + 'static {
    /// Propose a new block during leadership.
    ///
    /// Called when this validator is the leader for a slot. The implementation
    /// should:
    ///
    /// 1. Fetch pending transactions from the mempool
    /// 2. Execute transactions against the parent state
    /// 3. Compute the resulting state root
    /// 4. Construct and return a complete block
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `parent` - The digest of the parent block to build upon
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// Returns an error if:
    /// - The parent snapshot is not found
    /// - Transaction execution fails
    /// - Block construction fails

    /// Verify a block proposed by another validator.
    ///

    /// validates that the computed state root matches the block header.

    /// 1. Persist pending state changes to durable storage
    /// 2. Remove finalized transactions from the mempool
    /// 3. Clean up any temporary execution state
    ///
    /// # Arguments

    ///
    /// Seeds are derived from threshold VRF signatures during the consensus
    /// protocol. These seeds are used to populate the `prevrandao` field in
    /// subsequent blocks, providing a source of on-chain randomness.
